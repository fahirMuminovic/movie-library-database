# movie-library-database
My first "real" web page that I made for my Web Development class. The main goal was to make a database and display it's content on the web page.

## Disclaimer
As you may assume, this project need a lot of improvement and code optimization. But it works as is, and as intended.

## Requirements (Features)
The main list of requirements, or features of the web page is:

* User registration and login
* User can change password
* Displaying of relevant data from database
* User roles (admin, unregistered user, registered user)
* Enable CRUD for admin users
* Uniform design
* User sessions
* Form validation using JavaScript
* Filtering of data from database using JavaScript (without additional requests from database)
---
## Restrictions (Rules)

There were some restrictions or rules that were set. Most notably: 

* The web page must be made using the following: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL
* Using of additional frameworks is not allowed
